# Ethics focusing on Software developing and Data Science

                                  

## Background and Focus

- I'm Currently a Junior at GMU majoring in Information Technology. With a strong foundational knowledge in Programming, Cyber Security and Cloud.

## The Intersection of Programming and Ethics

- My keen interest in IT ethics, particularly in relation to programming, stems from an understanding of the profound impact that technology has on society. The rapid advancements in the IT sector, coupled with the increasing reliance on digital platforms, underscore the importance of ethical considerations in software development and deployment. Programming, as the backbone of technology development, sits at the center of this discourse, involving the creation of code that shapes the functionality and impact of technology.

## Ethical Programming: A Core Aspect of IT

- In my studies and observations, I've come to realize that the ethical aspects of IT, especially in programming, are central to the responsible practice of technology. This is particularly true in areas where programming decisions can significantly influence the security, privacy, and effectiveness of technology. My exploration in IT ethics delves into issues such as responsible code development, data privacy, the ethical use of AI and machine learning algorithms, the responsibilities of programmers towards users and society, and the role of policy in guiding ethical technology practices.

## A Commitment to Ethical Technology

- Through my work and research, I aim to offer a comprehensive outlook on IT ethics from a programmer's perspective. This includes discussing the necessity of ethical guidelines like those provided by IEEE and other organizations, examining case studies where programming decisions have had ethical implications, and exploring the broader societal impacts of technology. Ultimately, my goal is to contribute to a more secure, equitable, and ethically-informed digital world.
